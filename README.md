# Algorithmic Development

Here I solve algorithmic problems and I play with data structures.

Future plans:
- [ ] all input should be from a file (not stdin) and output should be to stdout (work in progress)
- [ ] create a utility library (header file) for finding time taken by an algorithm using sys/resource
